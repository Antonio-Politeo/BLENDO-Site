	<p>Hi, I am Brendon Chung. I founded Blendo Games and I make video games. I am a game designer, artist, and programmer. Some Blendo titles have won awards, including the IGF Seumas McNally Grand Prize, the IGF Excellence in Design, and the IndieCade Grand Jury.<p>
	<p>I haveve given various talks at the Game Developers Conference and panel talks at IndieCade, TwitchCon, LudoNarraCon, and more. Prior to founding Blendo Games, I was a level designer at Pandemic Studios.<p>
	<p>Outside of Blendo Games, I am also a co-founder of Los Angeles art collective Glitch City.<p>
	<p>Blendo Games is my full-time job, but I am open to short-term design consulting or narrative consulting. Please reach me via email.<p>
